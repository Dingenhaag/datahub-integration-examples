A New window opens that lists the content of the upload. For example, a KPI upload contains data on the affected dimensions, model, and story.

5.	If required, amend the import by selecting or deselecting the checkboxes for the listed content.

6.	Choose the Import icon and select options for overwriting data during the import.

If an object selected for import does not exist on your system, the object will be created and its data will be imported. For objects that already exist in your system, your selections in the Options window determine whether to overwrite the object and update its data. By default, existing objects will not be updated or overwritten.
